# The Issue
Say you mis-typed a password when creating an account in MySQL. Or perhaps, like me, you ended up with a word in your randomly generated password that you didn't like (for example, you got "imprudent" as one of your words, but you always confuse it for the similarly-spelled "impudent" and that 'r' really trips you up).
Regardless, you don't like your password, and you want to change it. This process is actually pretty simple, but you may run into a few roadblocks, which we'll discuss as they pop up.

#The process
First, we'll get into MySQL using root. The command for this is `sudo mysql -u root`.
